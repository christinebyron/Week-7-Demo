# Week-7-Demo Repository

This week focused on our project environment strategy. To best demonstrate this, we will create a production and development environment and deploy your code changes to both environments.

The steps taken include

    1.    Demonstrate that environments are matched to git branches
    2.    Make pull request against master branch
    3.    Verify new code in integration environment
    4.    Merge request into master branch
    5.    Merge code into the staging environment
    6.    Push validated changes into production
